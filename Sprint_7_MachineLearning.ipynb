Your approach demonstrates a good grasp of model development. However, to fully approve your project, there are critical criteria that you must meet, particularly in how you split and evaluate your data. The guidelines require training, validation, and test sets to be established before model selection and final evaluation.\n","\n","Below is a detailed review focusing on what must be accomplished to secure approval.\n","\n","---\n","\n","<div style=\"border-left: 7px solid green; padding: 10px;\">\n","<b>✅ Already Achieved:<\/b>\n","<ul>\n","  <li><b>Data Loading and Initial Exploration:<\/b> You successfully loaded the dataset and performed basic checks for duplicates and missing values. Using methods like `.head()` and `.info()` provided an initial understanding of the data structure.<\/li>\n","  <li><b>Model Variety:<\/b> Considered multiple classification algorithms—Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression—providing a diverse perspective on model performance.<\/li>\n","  <li><b>Hyperparameter Iteration for Random Forest:<\/b> Implemented loops to vary `n_estimators` and `max_depth` for the Random Forest model. This satisfies the requirement to iterate over different hyperparameter values.<\/li>\n","  <li><b>Accuracy Threshold Met:<\/b> Achieved a validation accuracy above 0.80 for the Random Forest, surpassing the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates strong predictive performance.<\/li>\n","<\/ul>\n","<\/div>\n","\n","<div style=\"border-left: 7px solid gold; padding: 10px;\">\n","<b>⚠️ Areas for Improvement (Not Required for Approval, but Recommended):<\/b>\n","<ul>\n","  <li><b>Additional Metrics:<\/b> Consider evaluating your model with additional metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to gain deeper insight into model performance beyond accuracy.<\/li>\n","  <li><b>Visualization Enhancements:<\/b> Adding confusion matrices, ROC curves, or feature importance plots would provide clearer insights into where the model excels and where it struggles.<\/li>\n","  <li><b>Comprehensive Conclusion:<\/b> Including a more thorough final discussion of your results—such as why the Random Forest outperformed other models, any observed limitations, and suggestions for future improvements—would give a stronger end to your analysis.<\/li>\n","<\/ul>\n","<\/div>\n","\n","<div style=\"border-left: 7px solid red; padding: 10px;\">\n","<b>⛔️ Critical Changes Required for Approval:<\/b>\n","<ul>\n","  <li><b>Proper Data Splitting into Three Sets:<\/b>\n","    <ul>\n","      <li><b>Issue:<\/b> You only created a training and validation split. The project criteria specify splitting the data into three sets: training, validation, and test.
