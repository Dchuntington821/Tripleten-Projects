# Tripleten-Projects

This repository contains all of the projects I've completed through my studies at Tripleten. There are three branches in which I divided the projects into three categories, 'EDA and Data Visualization' and 'Machine Learning', and 'Collaborative Projects'.

* EDA and Data Visualization is mainly comprised of projects focused on data analysis using Python and Python Libraries/Packages.

  - *Note:* The sprint 4 project is just the .ipynb for an application that was launched via render, here's the repo that contains the full project.

* The Machine learning category is comprised of all of the projects in which I created at least one predictive model. Most of these projects include data analysis, visualization, hypothesis testing and gradient boosting.

* The collaborative projects category only contains one project from a coding competition put on by Tripleten. In this branch there are 4 files, two pertain to a data scraper we built, one is data analysis, and one is the presentation.
