# Tripleten-Projects

This repository contains all of the projects I've completed through my studies at Tripleten. There are two branches in which I divided the projects into two main categories, 'EDA and Data Visualization' and 'Machine Learning'.

EDA and Data Visualization is mainly comprised of projects focused on data analysis using Python and Python Libraries/Packages.

The Machine learning category is comprised of all of the projects in which I created at least one predictive model. Most of these projects include data analysis, visualization, hypothesis testing and gradient boosting.

*Note: The sprint 4 project is just the .ipynb for an application launched through render, here's the link to the full project.
